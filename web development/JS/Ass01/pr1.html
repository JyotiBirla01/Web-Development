<!-- Q.1 Peak an element
An element is called a peak element if its value is not smaller than the value of its adjacent elements(if they exists).
Given an array arr[] of size N, find the index of any one of its peak elements.
Note: The generated output will always be 1 if the index that you return is correct. Otherwise output will be 0.
Example 1:
Input: N = 3
arr[] = {1,2,3}
Output: 1
Explanation: index 2 is 3.
It is the peak element as it is 
greater than its neighbor 2.
Example 2:
Input: N = 2
arr[] = {3,4}
Output: 1
Explanation: 4 (at index 1) is the 
peak element as it is greater than 
its only neighbor element 3.
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105.
1 ≤ A[ ] ≤ 106 -->
